# The Chuck Norris Joke Generator

This is just a silly joke generator made for fun in order to practice with the Fetch API in JavaScript.

This little project uses [The Internet Chuck Norris Database](http://www.icndb.com/)'s API to obtain the jokes. Also, since this project doesn't aim to work on my HTML/CSS skills, the library [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is used to produce a decent-ish looking page.
